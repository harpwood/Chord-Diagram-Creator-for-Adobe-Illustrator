### Prerequisites  

Adobe Illustrator is required to use this script.



### Recommended Fonts

You can use any font you like with the Chord Diagram Creator, as long as it is installed into your computer. However, is recommended to use the [Petaluma music fonts](https://github.com/steinbergmedia/petaluma), licensed under the SIL Open Font License. This license is very permissive to printing. If you have installed those fonts before the first launch, the script will detect them and will use them as the default fonts. If you install those fonts after launching the script for the first time, then you can either set them manually in Options -> Fonts Tab, or by pressing the button [Factory Reset] in Options -> Set Defaults Tab.
